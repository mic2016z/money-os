Subject: Quick question about after-hours cleaning at {{building_name}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I work with Sydney office buildings to improve cleaning reliability and SLA performance (especially after-hours consistency).

If useful, I can share a 1-page benchmark checklist we use to spot avoidable quality and compliance gaps in under 15 minutes.

Open to a quick chat this week?

Hi {{first_name}} — quick one: we’re helping Sydney CBD buildings tighten after-hours cleaning quality with measurable SLA checks. Happy to send a short benchmark checklist if useful.

## Follow-up
Bumping this in case useful — can send the checklist with no obligation. If timing is bad, happy to circle back next month.
